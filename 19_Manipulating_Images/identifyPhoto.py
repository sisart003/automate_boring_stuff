# Identifying Photo Folders on the Hard Drive
# I have a bad habit of transferring files from my digital camera to temporary
# folders somewhere on the hard drive and then forgetting about these folders.
# It would be nice to write a program that could scan the entire hard drive and
# find these leftover “photo folders.”
# Write a program that goes through every folder on your hard drive and
# finds potential photo folders. Of course, first you’ll have to define what you
# consider a “photo folder” to be; let’s say that it’s any folder where more than
# half of the files are photos. And how do you define what files are photos?
# First, a photo file must have the file extension .png or .jpg. Also, photos
# are large images; a photo file’s width and height must both be larger than
# 500 pixels. This is a safe bet, since most digital camera photos are several
# thousand pixels in width and height. 
# As a hint, here’s a rough skeleton of what this program might look like:
#! python3
# Import modules and write comments to describe this program.
# for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk('C:\\'):
#  numPhotoFiles = 0
#  numNonPhotoFiles = 0
#  for filename in filenames:
#  # Check if file extension isn't .png or .jpg.
# if TODO:
#  numNonPhotoFiles += 1
#  continue # skip to next filename
#  # Open image file using Pillow.
#  # Check if width & height are larger than 500.
#  if TODO:
#  # Image is large enough to be considered a photo.
#  numPhotoFiles += 1
#  else:
#  # Image is too small to be a photo.
#  numNonPhotoFiles += 1
#  # If more than half of files were photos,
#  # print the absolute path of the folder.
#  if TODO:
#  print(TODO)
# When the program runs, it should print the absolute path of any photo
# folders to the screen.
