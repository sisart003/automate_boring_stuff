# Command Line Emailer
# Write a program that takes an email address and string of text on the
# command line and then, using selenium, logs in to your email account
# and sends an email of the string to the provided address. (You might
# want to set up a separate email account for this program.)
# This would be a nice way to add a notification feature to your programs. You could also write a similar program to send messages from
# a Facebook or Twitter account
