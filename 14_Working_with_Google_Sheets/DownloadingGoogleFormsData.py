# Downloading Google Forms Data
# Google Forms allows you to create simple online forms that make it easy
# to collect information from people. The information they enter into the
# form is stored in a Google Sheet. For this project, write a program that can
# automatically download the form information that users have submitted.
# Go to https://docs.google.com/forms/ and start a new form; it will be blank.
# Add fields to the form that ask the user for a name and email address. Then
# click the Send button in the upper right to get a link to your new form,
# such as https://goo.gl/forms/QZsq5sC2Qe4fYO592/. Try to enter a few example
# responses into this form.
# On the “Responses” tab of your form, click the green Create
# Spreadsheet button to create a Google Sheets spreadsheet that will hold the
# responses that users submit. You should see your example responses in the
# first rows of this spreadsheet. Then write a Python script using EZSheets to
# collect a list of the email addresses on this spreadsheet.
