# Converting Spreadsheets to Other Formats
# You can use Google Sheets to convert a spreadsheet file into other formats.
# Write a script that passes a submitted file to upload(). Once the spreadsheet has uploaded to Google Sheets, download it using downloadAsExcel(),
# downloadAsODS(), and other such functions to create a copy of the spreadsheet
# in these other formats.
