# To see how much PyInputPlus is doing for you, try re-creating the multiplication quiz project on your own without importing it. This program will
# prompt the user with 10 multiplication questions, ranging from 0 × 0 to
# 9 × 9. You’ll need to implement the following features:
# •	 If the user enters the correct answer, the program displays “Correct!”
# for 1 second and moves on to the next question.
# •	 The user gets three tries to enter the correct answer before the
# program moves on to the next question.
# •	 Eight seconds after first displaying the question, the question is
# marked as incorrect even if the user enters the correct answer after
# the 8-second limit.
# Compare your code to the code using PyInputPlus in “Project: Multiplication Quiz”
