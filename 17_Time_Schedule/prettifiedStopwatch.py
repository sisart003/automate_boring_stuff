# Prettified Stopwatch

# Expand the stopwatch project from this chapter so that it uses the rjust()
# and ljust() string methods to “prettify” the output. (These methods were
# covered in Chapter 6.) Instead of output such as this:

# Lap #1: 3.56 (3.56)
# Lap #2: 8.63 (5.07)
# Lap #3: 17.68 (9.05)
# Lap #4: 19.11 (1.43)

# . . . the output will look like this:

# Lap # 1: 3.56 ( 3.56)
# Lap # 2: 8.63 ( 5.07)
# Lap # 3: 17.68 ( 9.05)
# Lap # 4: 19.11 ( 1.43)

# Note that you will need string versions of the lapNum, lapTime, and
# totalTime integer and float variables in order to call the string methods
# on them.

# Next, use the pyperclip module introduced in Chapter 6 to copy the text
# output to the clipboard so the user can quickly paste the output to a text
# file or email.
