# Excel-to-CSV Converter
# Excel can save a spreadsheet to a CSV file with a few mouse clicks, but if
# you had to convert hundreds of Excel files to CSVs, it would take hours of
# clicking. Using the openpyxl module from Chapter 12, write a program that
# reads all the Excel files in the current working directory and outputs them
# as CSV files.
# A single Excel file might contain multiple sheets; you’ll have to
# create one CSV file per sheet. The filenames of the CSV files should be
# <excel filename>_<sheet title>.csv, where <excel filename> is the filename of
# the Excel file without the file extension (for example, 'spam_data', not
# 'spam_data.xlsx') and <sheet title> is the string from the Worksheet object’s
# title variable.
# This program will involve many nested for loops. The skeleton of the
# program will look something like this:
# for excelFile in os.listdir('.'):
#  # Skip non-xlsx files, load the workbook object.
#  for sheetName in wb.get_sheet_names():
#  # Loop through every sheet in the workbook.
#  sheet = wb.get_sheet_by_name(sheetName)
#  # Create the CSV filename from the Excel filename and sheet title.
#  # Create the csv.writer object for this CSV file.
#  # Loop through every row in the sheet.
#  for rowNum in range(1, sheet.max_row + 1):
#  rowData = [] # append each cell to this list
#  # Loop through each cell in the row.
#  for colNum in range(1, sheet.max_column + 1):
#  # Append each cell's data to rowData.

#  # Write the rowData list to the CSV file.
#  csvFile.close()
