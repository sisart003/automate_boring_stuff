# Random Chore Assignment Emailer
# Write a program that takes a list of people’s email addresses and a list
# of chores that need to be done and randomly assigns chores to people.
# Email each person their assigned chores. If you’re feeling ambitious, keep
# a record of each person’s previously assigned chores so that you can make
# sure the program avoids assigning anyone the same chore they did last
# time. For another possible feature, schedule the program to run once a
# week automatically.
# Here’s a hint: if you pass a list to the random.choice() function, it will
# return a randomly selected item from the list. Part of your code could
# look like this:

# chores = ['dishes', 'bathroom', 'vacuum', 'walk dog']
# randomChore = random.choice(chores)
# chores.remove(randomChore) # this chore is now taken, so remove it
