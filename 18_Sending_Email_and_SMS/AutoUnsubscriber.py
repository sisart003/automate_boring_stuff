# Auto Unsubscriber
# Write a program that scans through your email account, finds all the
# unsubscribe links in all your emails, and automatically opens them in a
# browser. This program will have to log in to your email provider’s IMAP
# server and download all of your emails. You can use Beautiful Soup (covered in Chapter 12) to check for any instance where the word unsubscribe
# occurs within an HTML link tag.
# Once you have a list of these URLs, you can use webbrowser.open() to
# automatically open all of these links in a browser.
# You’ll still have to manually go through and complete any additional
# steps to unsubscribe yourself from these lists. In most cases, this involves
# clicking a link to confirm.
# But this script saves you from having to go through all of your emails
# looking for unsubscribe links. You can then pass this script along to your
# friends so they can run it on their email accounts. (Just make sure your
# email password isn’t hardcoded in the source code!)
